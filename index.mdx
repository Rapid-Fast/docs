# Overview

Lane Scrims' Modmail Bot is a Discord bot designed to streamline communication between server members and the staff team. Instead of members sending questions or concerns into public channels, Modmail creates private threads where staff can interact with them directly. This helps maintain privacy, keeps public channels free of clutter, and allows staff to manage member requests efficiently.

With Modmail, server members can report issues, ask for support, submit appeals, or raise questions without exposing their messages to the wider community. Staff can track, respond, and resolve these threads while keeping records, tagging messages for organization, and using built-in features like notes, tags, or transcripts.
