# Snippets & Templates

On Lane Scrims, staff can use pre-made replies (snippets) or create new ones to save time and ensure consistent communication. Snippets are useful for common questions, reminders, rule enforcement messages, or any message you find yourself sending frequently.

### Viewing Available Snippets

To see all snippets available for use:\
`?snippets list`

This will display a list of all pre-made messages, including the snippet name and a preview of its content. Review the list before creating new snippets to avoid duplicates and maintain a clean, organised set of templates.

### Sending a Snippet in a Thread

To send a snippet in a Modmail thread:\
`?snippets send <snippet_name>`

**Example:**\
`?snippets send welcome_message`

The snippet will be sent exactly as it was saved. This ensures that frequently used responses are consistent and professional across all staff members.

### Creating a New Snippet (If you have the permissions to do so)

To create a new snippet, use:\
`?snippets create <snippet_name> <text>`

**Example:**\
`?snippets create rules_reminder Please make sure to read and follow all Lane Scrims rules.`

* `<snippet_name>` should be a short, descriptive name for the snippet.
* `<text>` is the full content of the message you want saved.

### Editing an Existing Snippet

To update a snippet after it has been created:\
`?snippets edit <snippet_name> <new_text>`

**Example:**\
`?snippets edit welcome_message Welcome to Lane Scrims! Make sure to read the rules and have fun.`

### Deleting a Snippet

To remove a snippet that is no longer needed:\
`?snippets delete <snippet_name>`

**Example:**\
`?snippets delete old_warning_message`

### Best Practices

* Keep snippet names clear and descriptive. Avoid using overly long names.
* Update snippets when rules or procedures change to maintain accuracy.
* Use snippets to handle repetitive tasks, but personalize responses when necessary to maintain a human touch.
* Periodically review your snippets list with `?snippets list` to remove outdated messages and prevent clutter.
* Combine snippets with `?note <text>` for internal context if needed when responding to complex threads.

Using snippets efficiently ensures that Lane Scrims staff can respond quickly, consistently, and professionally, while also keeping internal communication streamlined.
