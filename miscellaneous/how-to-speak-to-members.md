# How to Speak to Members

When using Modmail on Lane Scrims, communication with members should always be professional, clear, and respectful. Proper tone and etiquette ensure threads remain productive, reduce misunderstandings, and maintain a positive server environment.

### General Tone Guidelines

* Always use polite language, even if a member is upset or frustrated.
* Avoid slang, sarcasm, or jokes that could be misinterpreted.
* Keep responses concise but informative. Long walls of text can overwhelm members.
* Use `?anonreply <text>` or `?ar <text>` if you need to send a reply anonymously while keeping your role visible rather than your name.

### Professionalism

* Identify yourself clearly when sending a non-anonymous reply using `?realreply <text>` or `?rr <text>`.
* Avoid personal opinions unless directly relevant to the member’s issue.
* Stay neutral when handling disputes or reports from members.
* Maintain confidentiality: do not disclose staff discussions within a thread.

### Responding Efficiently

* Use pre-made replies or snippets with `?snippets` to maintain consistency and save time.
* Confirm receipt of a member’s message before providing a detailed answer if it will take time.
* Use `?reply <text>` or `?r <text>` to respond directly and `?edit <number> <new text>` to fix any mistakes in your previous replies.
* Cancel unnecessary alerts using `?alert cancel` if you’ve already responded and no further pings are needed.

### Handling "Difficult" Members

* Stay calm and professional, even if a member is hostile.
* Avoid escalating conflicts; focus on clarifying rules and providing solutions.
* If necessary, use moderation commands such as `?block <userID>` or `?block <userID> <time>` to restrict disruptive behaviour.
* Document interactions using `?note <text>` to maintain a clear record for other staff.

### Best Practices (as always)

* Always double-check your replies for clarity and tone before sending.
* Keep a consistent approach across threads to ensure members know what to expect.
* Reference past interactions with `?logs <userID>` to provide context when responding.
* Use `?role` to display the correct staff role in replies, so members can easily identify the sender’s authority level.
