# Assignments & Claims

On Lane Scrims, assigning and claiming threads ensures that each Modmail thread has a clear staff owner. This prevents overlapping responses, ensures accountability, and helps the support team manage threads efficiently.

### Claiming a Thread

When you start handling a thread, claim it to show that you are the primary staff member responsible. This lets other staff know who is managing the conversation.

* Claiming is indicated by adding a note in the thread using `?note`.
* Example:\
  `?note Claimed by @ModName for handling.`
* Once claimed, you are responsible for all replies until the thread is closed or transferred.

### Transferring a Thread

If another staff member needs to take over a thread:

* Add a note with `?note` to indicate the transfer. Example:\
  `?note Transferred to @OtherMod for follow-up.`
* Update any internal tracking to mark the new staff member as responsible.

### Best Practices for Assignments

* Always claim threads you are actively replying to.
* Add notes immediately when transferring a thread to another staff member.
* Communicate clearly with other staff when handing off threads, especially for complex cases.
* Use consistent methods for marking claims so all staff know who is responsible at a glance.

Following these practices ensures that Modmail threads on Lane Scrims are handled efficiently, without conflicts or missed messages, providing the best support to server members.
