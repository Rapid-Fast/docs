# Escalations

Escalations are used to pass a Modmail thread to senior staff or handle sensitive cases that require higher-level attention. Proper escalation ensures that important issues are resolved quickly, and that sensitive information is treated appropriately.

### When to Escalate

Threads should be escalated in cases like:

* Complex issues that junior staff cannot resolve.
* Reports of harassment, threats, or serious misconduct.
* Situations requiring immediate senior staff intervention.
* Threads involving multiple users or sensitive coordination.

### Escalating Threads

To escalate a thread on Lane Scrims:

1. Leave a staff-only note summarising the situation using:\
   `?note <summary of issue>`
2. Notify senior staff via the serverâ€™s escalation channel or direct pings.
3. Move the thread to the designated escalation category if needed (we may not have one at the time of writing:\
   `?move <category>`

Senior staff will review the thread, communicate with the user if needed, and take action.

### Handling Sensitive Cases

For threads with sensitive content:

* Keep all discussion internal; do not share in public channels.
* Use `?note` to provide context for senior staff.
* Only escalate to trusted senior staff members.
* Use `?alert` to stay updated on new replies from senior staff.

### Reassigning Escalated Threads

Senior staff can claim ownership of an escalated thread or pass it to another qualified staff member:

* Claim the thread following the standard claiming process.
* Transfer ownership to another staff member if required.
* Update internal notes to document the escalation history.

### Best Practices

* Always summarise why the thread is being escalated in a `?note`.
* Keep all communication professional and concise.
* Use categories and notes consistently to track escalated threads.
* Follow up on escalated threads promptly.
* Document outcomes in the thread log for reference: `?loglink`.

Following these procedures ensures that all sensitive or complex issues on Lane Scrims are handled efficiently, responsibly, and securely.
